# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è30 Days of Smart Contract

> **On road to becoming Smart Contract developer üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

üìë This repo is based on a personal challenge which I took for myself, where I code smart contracts everyday for 30 days! üî•

üéØ Basic goal for me taking this challege is to learn more about Solidity, be able to create more smart contracts, and get a hang of it!

üë©‚Äçüíª All smart contracts rage from simple => complex/hard as days progress. Even if you are a beginner and want to make smart contracts, you can follow along with each day. Prior to this I have already completed [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) course till ERC721 lesson.

## üèó Let's Begin Building

> If you don't yet don't see the all the days üî¢ mentioned, means I am yet in progress

üìß You can run any of these smart contracts on [remix online IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) without need to install Solidity
