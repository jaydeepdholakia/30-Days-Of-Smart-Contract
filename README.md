> **On the road to becoming Smart Contract developer üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

üìë This repo is based on a personal challenge that I took for myself, where I code smart contracts and build end-to-end projects for 30 days! üî•

I had earlier thought of doing 30 smart contracts for 30 days, but I know me and I know I will burn out in 5 days üòÖ. So instead, thought of making end-to-end projects by which it will help me gain better knowledge of frontend and web3 also, as just coding smart contract will not be enough.

Here is the list of projects which I am going to spend on an average 3 days on each:
![projects-list](/readme-files/projects-list.png)

üéØ Basic goal for me taking this challenge is to learn more about Solidity, Web3/Ethers, Hardhat/Truffle, React, and be able to create more smart contracts, and get a hang of it!

üë©‚Äçüíª All smart contracts range from simple => complex/hard as days progress. Even if you are a beginner and want to make smart contracts, you can follow along with each day. Before this, I have already completed [Cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) course till the ERC721 lesson.

## üèó Let's Begin Building

> If you don't yet don't see all the days üî¢ mentioned, means I am yet in progress

üìß You can run any of these smart contracts on [remix online IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) without the need to install Solidity
