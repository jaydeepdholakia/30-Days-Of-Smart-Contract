# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hello-World-Project

Welcome to 1st project of this series. Here I coded a simple Hello World smart contract and displayed it's output on a UI

In fact, you can interact with it here: [Hello-World-Heroku](https://hello-world-30dosc.herokuapp.com/)

ü§î Well, you may think why I deployed it on Heroku instead of IPFS (A place blockchain devs loves to trust). But as you can see, the react app which is inside [public folder](/public/), which is inside this 1Ô∏è‚É£ Hello-World-Project, so direct deployment is not possible. So I deployed the app via sub-directory build on heroku


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jaydeepdholakia/30-Days-Of-Smart-Contract.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd 30-Days-Of-Smart-Contract\1-Hello-World-Project\client\
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```

  Then react app will run on your localhost, and you will be able to interact with app just like you can do with one I hosted on Heroku
